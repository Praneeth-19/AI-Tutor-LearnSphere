Photosynthesis is the process where green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to create their own food, converting light energy into chemical energy. This process utilizes carbon dioxide and water, producing glucose (a sugar) and oxygen as byproducts. The green pigment chlorophyll, found in chloroplasts, plays a crucial role in capturing sunlight.
